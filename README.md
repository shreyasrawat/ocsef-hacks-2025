# OCSEF Hacks 2025
Team Goofy Goobers developed a project called BykeSyte at the OCSEF Hackathon â€” a safety device for bikers that works as a smart rearview camera. Using an LED alert system, it lights up when a car or object gets too close, signaling the rider to move. BykeSyte adds an extra layer of protection, offering bikers greater peace of mind on the road.
