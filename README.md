# ocsef-hacks-2025
Team Goofy Goobers's project for the OCSEF Hackathon. A safety device for bikers that acts as a smart rearview camera. Using an LED, if a car or any object gets too close to you, it will light up indicating that you should move. This adds and extra layer of protection that allows a peace of mind while biking.
